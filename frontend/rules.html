<p class="rcorners">Be respectful and courteous</p>
<p>If someone you don't know allows you to come to their island for whatever reason, please 
be respectful of their island. Do not run through or dig up their flowers, do not cut down 
their trees, do not leave your trash around on their island, and do not harvest their rocks. 
The person inviting you is doing them a favor, please treat them respectfully. <i>In addition, some people 
may bring an item or tip bells as a "thank you" for the transaction, and this is a kind 
action but not required nor should be expected. Please do not harass others for tips, tipping is not a 
required action.</i>
<br>Also, if you're the one opening your island please do not troll people with crazy fences or other 
obstacles that will impede them from their necessary function(s) on your island.</br></p>
