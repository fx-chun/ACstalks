<p class="rcorners">Why don't we sign up with email?</p>
<p>Because we don't need it! We do not want to collect and store email addresses when
it isn't necessary. We only want you to provide necessary data, which is providing a
nickname, password, timezone, Nintendo Switch Friend Code, and your pricing data.</p>

<p class="rcorners">I lost my password! Help!</p>
<p>You will not be able to retrieve your password like you would on other websites
because we do not collect an email address. If you need help retrieving your password
please email us at 
<a href="mailto:dev@acstalks.com?subject="Lost Password">dev@acstalks.com</a> and let us
know that you need a password reset. Alternatively, you can create a new account and
<a href="mailto:dev@acstalks.com?subject="Delete Abandoned Account">email us</a> to
delete the abandoned account. You will need to provide the username for the account.</p>

<p class="rcorners">Will you make changes/updates?</p>
<p>We will do our best to continue updating the site as need, when we do make changes we
plan to post the updates to the changes in our Discord server 
<a href="https://discord.gg/epqw5mw">here</a> and check out the Updates channel! </p>

<p class="rcorners">What does it mean when my price is stale?</p>
<p>When your pricing goes stale it is because the website has determined that the price has 
been updated in your local time. Turnips have price changes twice a day: once at 8AM your local 
time and once again at 12PM your local time. Turnips are not sellable on Sundays all day since 
that is the day Daisy Mae comes to sell to you. To make your price no longer stale, please 
check your game and update it with the proper pricing.</p>
